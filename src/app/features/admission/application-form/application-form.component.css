/*
   Most styling is now handled by Bootstrap classes.
   You might only need this file for very specific, component-level overrides
   that Bootstrap doesn't directly support, or for highly custom elements.
*/

/* Example: If you wanted a slightly different padding or max-width than default container */
.container {
  max-width: 800px; /* Adjust container width */
}

/* You might need a specific class for the form if you reuse .form-control widely */
/* For example, if you wanted unique styling for THIS form's labels */
/* .application-form-container label {
  font-weight: 600;
} */
